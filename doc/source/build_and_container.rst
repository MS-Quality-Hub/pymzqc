Build and Container
===================

The simplest way to get pymzqc is through `PyPi <https://pypi.com/project/pymzqc>`_

If you need to build it your self or do not want to use `pip` (or can), there are alternatives:

Container
---------
One alternative is to use a container. 

.. include:: ../../containers/README.md
   :parser: myst_parser.sphinx_

Build
-----
Another alternative is to build a wheel yourself. 
This is the release documentation for the project.

.. include:: ../../BUILD.md
   :parser: myst_parser.sphinx_
