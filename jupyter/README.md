# Jupyter python notebooks

This folder contains various iterations of python notebooks for different occasions.
We can recommend the colab notebooks:
* [read mzQC in 5 minutes](colab/read_in_5_minutes.md) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MS-Quality-hub/pymzqc/blob/v1.0.0rc1/jupyter/colab/read_in_5_minutes.ipynb)
* [write mzQC in 5 minutes](colab/write_in_5_minutes.md) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MS-Quality-hub/pymzqc/blob/v1.0.0rc1/jupyter/colab/write_in_5_minutes.ipynb)


## preview update 
```
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown '/workspaces/pymzqc/jupyter/colab/write_in_5_minutes.ipynb'
```
This will create an updated static markdown render to /workspaces/pymzqc/jupyter/colab/write_in_5_minutes.md

[comment]: rst include of ipynb with myst_nb.sphinx_ didn't work. Maybe try with embedded html as separate pages below this page? https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/export_embedded/readme.html
