# Jupyter python notebooks

This folder contains various iterations of python notebooks for different occasions.
We can recommend the colab notebooks:
* [read mzQC in 5 minutes](/jupyter/colab/read_in_5_minutes.md)
* [write mzQC in 5 minutes](/jupyter/colab/write_in_5_minutes.md)

## preview update 
```
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown '/workspaces/pymzqc/jupyter/colab/write_in_5_minutes.ipynb'
```
This will create an updated static markdown render to /workspaces/pymzqc/jupyter/colab/write_in_5_minutes.md
